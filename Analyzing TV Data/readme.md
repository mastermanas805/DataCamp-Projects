# Analyzing TV Data

Television entertainment was once, bigest entertainment industry in United States. In this project, I looked at Super Bowl Data, generating insights into game outcomes, viewership, and even halftime shows. I developed an informative plot that helps to visualize the viewership and quality of the office throughout along its nine seasons. I used a combination of data manipulation and visualization to explore television data. Data for this projects was scapped from wikipidea by my DataCamp instructor.
